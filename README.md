# Description

This is a running list of various ideas that I come up with. 

Ideas can be really, _really_ powerful, but they can also be useless if they never creep out from the dark recesses of our minds. Additionally, choosing which of our ideas to realize and which to cast aside is a hard problem. 

However, I think that we can lower the mental and emotional burden of having too many ideas by sharing some of them so that others can, given enough inspiration, realize them. That is what this repo aims to do.

# Format 

I've tried to group the ideas into rough categories. The majority of them are tech- or software-related. Under each item, there is a brief (or not brief, depending on how inspired I felt at the time) description of what the idea entails. I've also added a brief label beside each idea name to indicate my state of progressing towards implementing/realizing the idea. The labels are:
- ***&check;*** : **Done**. I've implemented a version of this idea and consider it to be finished.
- **_WIP_** : **Work In Progress**. I'm _actively_ working on this idea, or will be actively working on it as soon as possible.
- ****_DNF_**** : **Did Not Finish**. I'm _not_ actively working on this idea, but I was at one point.
- **_NA_** : **Not Attempted**. Coincidentally, this sounds like "nah", which could also reflect disinterest in some of the ideas labeled with this.

## Linguistics

- [**_NA_**] `LAC -> Linguistic Anthropology Club`
    - Start a club about linguistic anthropology at school (or online). Read and discuss articles like those that appear in [Language Log](https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/).


## Math

- [**_NA_**] `PUP -> Proofs Under Pressure`
    - A fun video series where I try to prove a random theorem under time pressure.

## Software

### Automation
- [****_DNF_****] `AE -> Automate Everything`
    - An “automation engine” that enables me to automate different parts of my life. In particular, one application that would be cool to see would be a meal prep bot of sorts:
        - I feed it information on what groceries I currently have in stock, and it then scours the web looking for recipes that match/use those ingredients. It then chooses 3-4 items which I can meal prep for the week, and generates a document containing each recipe’s ingredients, the website(s) where those ingredients were found, and any other relevant information related to preparing the food.

- [**_NA_**] `AutoCo`
    - Companies are essentially conglomerations of humans wrapped up in a legal entity. What would happen if I created / ran a company that’s _completely_ automated? The only human role would be the creation of the company, but contacting customers, building the product, etc. would all be done by intelligent, non-human agents.


### CLI Tools

- [**_NA_**] `Rich HN`
    - HN CLI-based reader app that has pretty formatting as a result of using the [rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) Python library.

- [**_NA_**] `cli-mail (pronounced "clee mail")`
    - Email client for the terminal. Apparently there are a good number of these already in existence, but this might be a fun way to learn about SMTP / IMAP / POP3 etc.

- [**_NA_**] `slackli`
    - Slack command-line client with `more` style scrolling

- [****_DNF_****] `cli-pkb`
    - A command-line PKB (personal knowledge base) tool

### Databases

- [**_NA_**] `ShedDB`
    - DB with Load Shedding as a First-Class Primitive/Capability. Inspired by [this](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6KuRyXJLZCbTkXJLq6AYlf?context=spotify%3Ashow%3A5bBki72YeKSLUqyD94qsuJ&si=5tl-iSxlQWK28QDMzofC7g) Changelog podcast episode called "Estimating Systems with Napkin Math". I don't remember the context of this exactly, so you'd have to listen to the podcast to grok it fully. Not even sure how feasible this is technically speaking, as my DB-fu is quite weak at the moment.

### Education 

- [**_NA_**] `(Xerox) Printers, POSIX, and Programmers: A History of Free and Open Source Software`
    - A CS elective class about the history of free & open source software. Semester-long project involving contributing to an open source project of one’s choice. Whether contributions are successfully integrated or not, students give short “tech talks” (or writeups) throughout semester about what they know about the history and architecture of the project thus far. Students also learn about licensing, and maybe read about some of the projects detailed in [AOSA](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html).

- [**_NA_**] `COVIDUM -> COVID University Monitor`
    - Website that lets you view the statuses of opening for all colleges in the US

- [**_NA_**] `REU Alerts Program`
    - Application that lets you subscribe to receive updates about [REU](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/) programs in/at/with specific subjects, states, institutions, researchers, etc.


### Music

- [**_NA_**] `mus-diff`
    - Spotify tool that performs a music-based diff between two or more playlists, so you could, for instance, compare a playlist with a friend and then add everything you don't have that's on their playlist to yours.

- [**_NA_**] `musai`
    - Generate music that only an AI/computer could play, like a piano solo requiring three hands or something weird like that.

- [**_NA_**] `mus-to-mov(ie)`
    - Generative AI that creates a plot for a movie based on a given music score. Inspired by looking at the Passenger 57 [music score](https://open.spotify.com/album/2teeQSWvjGN0XRYtoYeTtP). This could be hilarious.

- [**_NA_**] `Follow Along`
    - Tool for following along with lyrics on sites like Genius.com. Thinking something along the lines of a curvy line with a dot that jumps from one word to the next, kind of like you see in children’s cartoons sometimes. The color of the line/dot will be customizable; this may be a Safari browser plugin or a separate mobile app altogether. It could even use something like Shazam to detect where you are in the song and start the lyric following from there.

### Nature

- [**_NA_**] `NatureQR`
    - QR Codes shaped like/embedded with pictures of the places they represent. Imagine an oak tree embedded in a QR code, for instance

- [**_NA_**] `Shodan.io Nature Cam`
    - Use Shodan API to go to random nature cams when user reloads the site

- [**_NA_**] `Electronic Waste Report`
    - Curate unique ways to reduce e-waste based on user location

- [**_NA_**] `TrashCVY`
    - App that uses OCR/CV to determine if an item can be recycled (not super inspired by this idea honestly)

- [**_NA_**] `BirdCV`
    - Bird sound and/or OCR identification

- [**_NA_**] `Natweb` _or_ `Noogle`
    - Search engine for discovering literature about nature based on themes or images inputted by the user. For instance, if I submit an image of a rare plant, the app returns research literature about the area.

- [**_NA_**] `what3trees`
    - 3D Maps & Satellite Imagery: could make a [what3words](https://what3words.com/clip.apples.leap) but with nature-focused literature instead. Imagine the location of [Love Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Canal) is called `superfund-waste-niagara` or something like that.

- [**_NA_**] `VCN -> Version Control for Nature`
    - A fancy way of saying, "look at the changes in a given natural location over time based on satellite image and potentially other forms of data as well". I think Google Earth basically does this already.

- [**_NA_**] `treejobs.com`
    - Nature careers website

- [**_NA_**] `@trees_bot`
    - Nature picture Twitter bot and/or website

- [**_NA_**] `WATACULTURE!` _or_ `OpenCulture`
    - OpenStreetMap combined with stories and music about particular places (i.e. location-curated playlists). I'm thinking something along the lines of, for example, traveling to a mountainous part of NC and then having the app suggest you music by local musicians and/or providing you with literature that exemplifies some of the important/well-known ideas and culture of the area. This _could_ help bring back some of the uniqueness and individuality of towns/cities now that all are under the purview of search engines and can be nicely (but lossily) ["summed up"](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/orthographic/) in terms of attractions, weather, and demographics -- or it could exacerbate it by seemingly further commodifying these places?

- [****_DNF_****] `thisgardendoesntexist.net (GAN)`
    - Basically [thiswaifudoesnotexist](https://www.thiswaifudoesnotexist.net/), but for images of gardens. This could even be extended to general landscapes.

- [**_NA_**] `Pollen™️`
    - A {social network | dating site} for nature enthusiasts. I'm not interested in building dating sites honestly, but a social network that lets people get together could be interesting.


### On-Demand Economy

- [**_NA_**] `RemoteDrone`
    - The cloud, but for drones. Rent a private drone for a period of time.

### Open Source

- [**&check;**] [`Project Types`](project-types.github.io/)
    - Realize the notion of the different open source project classifications that Nadia Eghbal talks about in Working In Public in a simple, usable format. Make GitHub stickers/badges that projects can put on their READMEs describing their project type, and make an associated website for it, too.

- [**_NA_**] `NeXT Job`
    - An open source job finder framework that enables you to easily make industry-specific job boards

- [**_WIP_**] `This Weekend's Repo`
    - Do a series on my blog where each weekend, I look at a different, high-quality open source repository on Github and try to understand it and break down what it’s doing. I'll use this to learn and to teach others simultaneously. I can probably enhance this with doodles etc. that describe the code, and having to write about things will force me to understand things more deeply. Potentially have a corresponding YouTube channel.

- [**_WIP_**] [`Code Reading Club`](https://codereading.club/)
    - Related to “This Weekend’s Repo”. Create a code reading club: a community of people who get together and read (open source) code together. There should be some way of pairing/grouping people together based on skill level, opportunity for code reviews, and discussions about the design aspects of software development. Inspired by mention of the weekly design discussions Dr. Jennings had in graduate school.
        - Like a book club, except the “books” are code from open source libraries. We (somehow) find a way to roughly match the code being read by a particular group with their skill level in gradations ranging from complete beginner to advanced, in hopes of ensuring inclusivity is a first-class citizen. We stagger code reading discussions throughout the week so that everyone has a chance to join any discussion they want outside of their default session. We facilitate discussions on not only the function, but also the _form_, of the code, which enables us to talk about design.
        - There should be a Slack or [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) channel for this.
        - Maybe try to center the code in some sort of specific historical/organizational context if appropriate? 
        - Have open source speakers come in occasionally. Talk about methods for reading code in codebases of different sizes. Try to expose people to new languages deliberately.
        - Prior and Related Art:
            - https://github.com/neontribe/code-reading-club/
            - https://www.felienne.com/archives/6472
            - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/join-the-code-book-club/
        - In this hypothetical code reading club where people meet monthly/bi-weekly/weekly to discuss code & design (for fun and profit), what are the best ways to:
            1. choose open source code that’s at an appropriate level for a given group of readers (consider potentially multiple groups of varying skill levels)
                - Maybe go over the same code, but at varying levels of detail/abstraction?
            2. Create a truly inclusive environment where people feel free to express their ideas about/related to the code, and aren't overly intimidated by not having as much experience as others in the (virtual) room.
            3. Make the learning environment cooperative, rather than competitive. The goal here is to prevent excessive oneupmanship.
    
### Privacy

- [**_DNF_**] `Privacy Policy Visualizer`
    - Privacy policies and terms and conditions are often pretty hard to read and understand thoroughly. Solution: Encode information contained in a privacy policy and/or terms and conditions in a graphical representation (think of something like a use case diagram)

- [**_NA_**] `DGMS -> De-Google Migration Service`
    - A service that quickly and efficiently enables you to migrate your online accounts away from Google. Presumably, one could apply this to other companies with lots of reach and access to customer data, but Google is the one in the hot seat right now so...

### Productivity

- [**_NA_**] `ENRGY`
    - Managing your time is hard, but managing your energy is even harder.  Solution: Make people more aware of fluctuations in their energy levels throughout the day so that they don’t waste effort slogging through work that they don’t have the energy to do. How?
        1. Newsletter to promote awareness and educate people.
        2. Some sort of blood glucose monitor that might help indicate when energy levels are low (e.g. a Fitbit-like wearable device). This could be integrated in with a mobile app. Advantage of this is that people can see how their energy levels fluctuate, proxied by blood glucose levels, over the course of hours, days, weeks, etc.
        3. Creepy idea: use eye-tracking and pupil dilation as a proxy for current level of attention/concentration. If pupil dilation is reduced for too long, suggest that the user take a break.

- [**_NA_**] `Productivity Tips to Try (from The Organized Mind by Daneil Levitin)`
    1. Use a 3x5 index card system for categorization and organization
    2. Consider setting aside only two times during the day for answering emails.
    3. Make a web extension that enables a custom, stripped down, faster Gmail.
    4. Make a bot that can tell you or others who are communicating when someone has broken one of the four [Gricean maxims of conversation](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/dravling/grice.html). This could be funny.
    5. Experiment with bimodal sleep patterns.

### Programming Languages

- [**_NA_**] `HEPTAPOD-B`
    - Create a digital font for the written version of the language used by the heptapods in the movie [Arrival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_(film)). Use the font, in combination with a custom-made code editor, to make a programming language called HEPTAPOD-B that allows you to program using the heptapod language. This would be a weird/fun way of trying to play with the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis concepts from the movie (and the [book](http://raley.english.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/Reading/Chiang-story.pdf) that inspired it) in a fan fiction-y sort of way.

- [**_WIP_**] `SOML -> Sound of Music Lang`  _or_ `mus` (pronounced like "muse")
    - A programming language inspired by Piet, but for sound. Instead of programs that look like abstract paintings, they _sound_ like music of some sort! In other words, to create a program, you write music and feed a suitable representation of it (like .mp3, .wav, etc.) to the `SOML`/`mus` interpreter!
        - This makes me consider an interesting question: _What does the intersection of programming language design and accessibility look like?_ _Would a `SOML`/`mus` programmer that is blind find the experience  to be more accessible than programming with "standard" languages?_

### Reflection and Ideation

- [**_NA_**] `Idea-as-a-Service`
    - Coming up with novel ideas is hard. Treat an idea as a node in a network. There are multiple types of links between ideas. The idea network can be encoded as a graph database. The “most useful” — however one defines “useful” — ideas are evidenced by common measures of centrality in graphs. I may be baking a lot of assumptions into this one.

- [**_NA_**] `JournalMe`
    - We don’t know ourselves well enough. Journaling software that aids in reflection by providing suggestions for what to focus on, recognizing patterns in previous entries, and following up with you later on about your thoughts on a particular topic. 

- [**_NA_**] `JournalMe 2.0`
    - Nesting of entries in a format that enables you to make a statement, then ask a question about that. Then the nesting increases so you can answer that question, then ask another question to that, etc. ad infinitum.

- [**_NA_**] `The Awareness Podcast`
    - Podcast informing people of how to become more self-aware, how to think about and situate themselves in the “rat race” of capitalistic society (if we choose to frame it that way), and ultimately, how to live happier, more fulfilled lives

- [**&check;**] `Explore Your Relationship with Creation and Consumption`
    - Inspired by Tim Ferriss’s ["17 Questions that Changed my Life”](https://tim.blog/2016/12/07/testing-the-impossible-17-questions-that-changed-my-life/) blog post. One question Tim asks himself is, _What if I did the opposite?_ 
        - You can use this question as inspiration in your own life. Ask, _What things am I doing right now?_ _What would the opposite of those things look like?_ One thing I personally notice is that right now, I spend a lot of time consuming content written by others. _What if I took the time I use to consume others’ content and instead used that time to create my own content?_ It doesn’t even have to be written content necessarily; it could be anything.

### Searching and Indexing

- [**_NA_**] `GHSearch`
    - Project enabling full text search on GitHub READMEs (or in general, markup language files) on repos. Can use it to locate and estimate the level of usage of the project type badges on GitHub. Where would I even start with this?

- [**_NA_**] `Custom 404`
    - Custom 404 page creation service @ custom404[dot]com

### Software Interoperability

- [**_NA_**] `IMF -> Issue Migration Format`
    - JSON-based (or just JSON-inspired?) format that makes it easy to migrate a project’s issues and PRs between different code hosting platforms, bug trackers, etc. Create some notion of threads for conversations that happen in issues on GitHub.
  
### Socializing and Working with Other Humans

- [**_NA_**] `Send2Friend`
    - Use Twilio to send gratitude text messages to friends on random dates within a given interval. This could be used for serendipitously contacting former coworkers or friends from school.

- [**_NA_**] `GrocerEZ`
    - Family/friend grocery list app. Firebase backend, basic JS/CSS frontend, shared list that users can easily edit (add, remove, change entry name). Can speed up shopping trips since you can split off into a group in pursuit of separate items, knowing that the list is updated in real time.

### Technology and Social Change

- [**_DNF_**] `SDH -> Software-defined Housing`
    - Material that responds to code and enables one to arrange the material in almost any way, including load-bearing, upright structures. Could be used to build cheap housing, potentially. I was inspired by work done by MIT on soft robotics.

- [**_NA_**] `The New Net Project`
    - Rural Broadbandification Project on the scale of that initiated by the Federal Aid Highway Act. Inspired by `bsder` and `gen220` on HN.

### Visualization

- [**_NA_**] `GitTrees`
    - Git branch visualization extension for VS Code. Someone has already created this, but it could be a useful learning exercise.

- [**_NA_**] `pynetmap`
    - A network mapping tool built in Python. Again, such a tool already [exists](https://nmap.org/), but it could be a good learning exercise.

- [**_NA_**] `MathGraph`
    - A math concept web with a sleek, graph-based GUI and a fractal nature, meaning that you can expand a node for a given concept to get more specific/nitty-gritty information in the form of sub-concept nodes. Continue expansion ad-infinitum. Maybe mine data from Wikipedia? Not sure of the ethics/harm that would cause if it turns out to be a lot of data. I imagine the Math topic has thousands of articles and even more associated references. Maybe treating this more like a math personal knowledge base makes more sense.

## Writing

- [**_NA_**] `"On Separation"`
    - Separating a person from their work. Wondering if American culture is unique in that the connection between work and identity is so strong that people doing “bad” jobs become “bad” people. How valid is that? Should explore further.
